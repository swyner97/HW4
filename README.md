## CSE360 Team Project CSE360-Team11
## Project Structure and Deliverables
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project Code
- All code is located in the /src/ directory in main
- IMPORTANT NOTE: we have organized our files to help with coding. In src.application we still have StartCSE360.java, and src.databasePart1 still has DatabaseHelper.java. Then you will see packages: logic, model, and pages. Logic handles the common validation methods and such. Model contains the classes of objects, and pages contains the classes that are made up of the objects, and the classes responsible for the user interface.
